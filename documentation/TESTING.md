## Issues during development
This section covers the major issues I encountered during the development and testing process and the solutions that fixed them.
### Navigation
* Issue: The navigation links were bunched up too close to each other
* Solution: I removed the styling for .nav-item divs and started over by styling the nav-item links only

* Issue: The slogan in the header would overlap the navbar
* Solution: I changed the z-index of the navbar to 2 which fixed the issue

### Header (zooming background)
* Issue: The zooming background div would overlap the navbar 
* Solution: I gave the navbar a z-index of 1 to place it over the zooming background div

* Issue: The overlapping of the zooming background div issue persisted 
* Solution: I changed the overflow of both header divs to hidden with the help of [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32524423/zooming-an-image-on-hover-and-not-exceeding-parent-div-borders)

### Responsive design
* Issue: The About section would not respond responsively when changing the screen width in Google Dev Tools Responsive Viewer
* Solution: I set the width of the whole About section to 100% which fixed the issue

* Issue: There was white space showing on the side of the website when in mobile & tablet screen size in Responsive Viewer

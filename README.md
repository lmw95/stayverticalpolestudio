# Stay Vertical Pole Studio 
Based on a fictional business offering pole dancing lessons, this website was built for educational-only purposes for Code Insitute's Full Stack Development diploma. This is a fully responsive website that was built with user-centric principles in mind, using HTML and CSS. 

The live website can be found [here.](https://lmw95.github.io/stayverticalpolestudio/)

# UX 
## Strategy 
Stay Vertical is a fictional pole studio based in Lowestoft Suffolk which is the only one of its kind in the town, set up by a former adult entertainer who is fully insured, and has high-ranking qualifications in teaching pole dancing and health and safety. 

The studio is relatively new, but is looking to expand their customer base and their local pole community through social media, and as a small business they want to get ahead of the curve in terms of responsive design for all devices!

Due to the recent increase in customers, Stay Vertical is looking for a modern, responsive website that boosts their online presence and welcomes users from their very first visit.

## Goals
### Business Goals 
By having a new website, the business owner wants to:
* Create and grow an online and in-person community
* Expand customer base
* Promote inclusivity and accessibility
* Advertise classes to customers, both new to pole and existing pole dancers

### User Goals
When visiting the website, the user wants to:
* Access website across a range of devices
* See the range of classes and bookings (prices, ability levels and lesson types)
* To access the owners contact information
* Check where company is located (locality)
* To feel comfortable attending classes without fear of discrimination or self-conscious

## User Stories 
### First-time users
As a first-time user:
* I want the website to work on all devices
* I want to be inspired by the studio as soon as I enter the page
* I want to feel comfortable that I will be welcome here
* I want the website to be easy to navigate
* I want to know where the company is located 
* I want the owners contact details so that I can ask any questions 
* It is important to know what to wear and bring to my first lesson with this studio
* It is important that the information is not cluttered on the page
* I want to know about the instructors to feel at ease
* I want to see a description about the classes so that I can judge my comfort levels and feel comfortable with the class I will be attending
* I want to know about COVID-19 precautions so I know I will be safe during my time at the studio

### Returning users:
As a returning user:
* I want to be able to submit an enquiry quickly through the website as I am now familiar with the owners
* I expect the social media links to work and open in another tab so that I can join the local community
* I want to know more about the instructors credentials so that I can recommend them to my friends
* I want a clear and simple booking system that I can use quickly
* I want to see reviews so that I can recommend to my friends
* I want to see opening times/timetable so that I can plan for future classes
* I want to know about COVID-19 precautions so I know I will be safe during my lessons
* I want to be able to buy merchandise so that I can represent the pole studio when in public
* I want to be able to leave a review on TripAdvisor so I can promote the company 
* I want to see that there is a refund and cancellation policy so that I can get my money back if I miss a class

### Business owner:
As the business owner:
* I want a to create an online presence that stands out from the competition
* I want to provide clear navigation of the website to advertise classes and prices
* I want to emphasise inclusivity and accessibility in my studio
* I want to feature my and my instructors' backstories so customers can feel at ease when they first visit

## Wireframes
Due to length restrictions on Mockup Plus Classic, the mobile and tablet wireframes are split in two parts
### [Desktop wireframe](https://github.com/lmw95/stayverticalpolestudio/blob/master/wireframes/desktop-wireframe.png)
### [Tablet wireframe part 1](https://github.com/lmw95/stayverticalpolestudio/blob/master/wireframes/tablet-wireframe.png)
### [Tablet wireframe part 2](https://github.com/lmw95/stayverticalpolestudio/blob/master/wireframes/tablet-wireframe(part%202).png)
### [Mobile wireframe part 1](https://github.com/lmw95/stayverticalpolestudio/blob/master/wireframes/mobile-wireframe.png)
### [Mobile wireframe part 2](https://github.com/lmw95/stayverticalpolestudio/blob/master/wireframes/mobile-wireframe(part2).png)

### Differences to wireframes:
* DESKTOP/OVERALL
    * There is no logo in the navigation menu, rather it sits in the hero image itself
    * The about section is in two parts only, not three
    * The 'Get to know us' button is now 'See our classes' and stretches across the whole screen
    * There is no row of images in the classes section
    * The classes and reviews sections are in interactive carousels rather than static layouts
    * The class buttons stretch across the whole screen with a width of 25% each
    * The instructors section is now in a simple 2x2 grid formation with hoverable/clickable overlays for the profile information
    * The social media icons now sit in the Reviews/Testimonials section, with the link to TripAdvisor

* TABLET
    * The instructors profiles are in a grid display, rather than in a row
    * Phone and other contact info sits to the side of the form rather than below

* MOBILE
    * The navbar sits above the header and collapses into a hamburger menu
    * The instructors certifications appear on the hoverable/clickable profiles
    * The instructors profiles are in a column, not in a grid display

## Design 
### Colours
My colours were chosen to be gender neutral, with a contrast that is both bold yet inviting. I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to help me choose my palette:

![Colour palette](https://github.com/lmw95/stayverticalpolestudio/blob/master/documentation/screenshots/colour-palette.png)

* #191919 is a nice slightly-off black cthat is used for the text on light backgrounds, the navigation menu and the footer
* #E8E8E8 is a clean off-white that is used for text on dark backgrounds and the background of some sections (classes and contact)
* #564256 is a bold purple that is used for the about section main title, the instructors section and used as background colour for the classes carousel and parts of the contact section
* #FC814A is a bright orange that is used for icons, links and the navigation menu text

### Icons
I have used icons sparingly throughout the website, only acting as bullet points in lists or to signify social media. I did this so as not to overclutter the page and distract from the content itself. All the icons I used in the project are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

### Fonts
The fonts I have used are all from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). I wanted to ensure readability, so used sans-serif fonts [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=poppins) for the main text and [Homemade Apple](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Homemade+Apple?category=Handwriting#standard-styles) for the slogan for an almost-handwritten aesthetic.

### Images 
All images on the website are to display pole dancing in action and to excite users into booking a class:
* The hero image is designed to grab the users attention when they first land on the website and show the power of the pole, which tells the user directly what services are offered by the company.
* The logo in the hero image is to display the branding to the user immediately.
* The image in the introduction is to show off the studio itself in a colour that matches the palette of the website.
* The images in the classes section is to reflect the different levels of class that the studio offers.
* The instructor profile images are to show the instructors in action, so that users will feel assured they are in good hands if they decided to use the company's services.
* The background image of the testimonials section is to provide one last display of pole-dancing before the user exits the page to the footer.
* The images used in the gallery page represent activity at the studio and what students can look forward to when they join.

### Structure
I have chosen [CSS Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) to structure my website. CSS Flexbox is simple to use and allows
for easy restructuring for responsive design across screen sizes. This way, I can have assurance that my website will

# Stay Vertical Pole Studio 
Based on a fictional business offering pole dancing lessons, this website was built for assignment purposes for Code Insitute's Full Stack Development diploma. This is a fully responsive website that was built with user-centric principles in mind, using HTML and CSS.

# UX 
## Strategy 
Stay Vertical is a fictional pole studio based in Lowestoft Suffolk which is the only one of its kind in the town, set up by a former adult entertainer who is fully insured, and has high-ranking qualifications in teaching pole dancing and health and safety. 

The studio is relatively new, but is looking to expand their customer base and their local pole community through social media.

Due to the recent increase in customers, Stay Vertical is looking for a modern, responsive website that boosts their online presence and welcomes users from their very first visit.

## Goals
### Business Goals 
By having a new website, the business owner wants to:
* Create and grow an online and in-person community
* Expand customer base
* Promote inclusivity and accessibility
* Advertise classes to customers, both new to pole and existing pole dancers

### User Goals
When visiting the website, the user wants to:
* Access website across a range of devices
* See the range of classes and bookings (prices, ability levels and lesson types)
* To access the owners contact information
* Check where company is located (locality)
* To feel comfortable attending classes without fear of discrimination or self-conscious

## User Stories

## Wireframes
Due to length restrictions on Mockup Plus Classic, the mobile and tablet wireframes are split in two parts
### [Desktop wireframe](https://github.com/lmw95/stayverticalpolestudio/blob/master/wireframes/desktop-wireframe.png)
### [Tablet wireframe part 1](https://github.com/lmw95/stayverticalpolestudio/blob/master/wireframes/tablet-wireframe.png)
### [Tablet wireframe part 2](https://github.com/lmw95/stayverticalpolestudio/blob/master/wireframes/tablet-wireframe(part%202).png)
### [Mobile wireframe part 1](https://github.com/lmw95/stayverticalpolestudio/blob/master/wireframes/mobile-wireframe.png)
### [Mobile wireframe part 2](https://github.com/lmw95/stayverticalpolestudio/blob/master/wireframes/mobile-wireframe(part2).png)

### Differences to wireframes:


## Design 
### Colours
My colours were chosen to be gender neutral, with a contrast that is both bold yet inviting. I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to help me choose my palette:

![Colour palette](/documentation/screenshots/my-colours.png)

* #191919 is an off-black which is used for the header and footer, and the text colour on lighter backgrounds and as the overlays.
* #FFF380 is a warm cream which us used for text on dark backgrounds.
* E09F3E is a golden colour which is used for the colour of icons in the footer.
* 9A5526 is a light brown will is used for the buttons.
* C1121F is a bold crimson which will be used as the background colour for the intro and instructor section.

### Icons
I have used icons sparingly throughout the website, only acting as bullet points in lists or to signify social media. I did this so as not to overclutter the page and distract from the content itself. All the icons I used in the project are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

### Fonts
The fonts I have used are all from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). I wanted to ensure readability, so used sans-serif fonts [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=poppins) for the main text and [Homemade Apple](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Homemade+Apple?category=Handwriting#standard-styles) for the slogan for an almost-handwritten aesthetic.

### Images 
All images on the website are to display pole dancing in action and to excite users into booking a class:
* The hero image is designed to grab the users attention when they first land on the website and show the power of the pole, which tells the user directly what services are offered by the company.
* The image in the introduction is to show off the studio itself in a colour that matches the palette of the website.
* The four images in the classes section is to reflect the four purposes of the service provided by the company.
* The instructor profile images are to show the instructors in action, so that users will feel assured they are in good hands if they decided to use the company's services.
* The background image of the testimonials section is to provide one last display of pole-dancing before the user exits the page to the footer.

### Structure
I have chosen [CSS Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) to structure my website. CSS Flexbox is simple to use and allows
for easy restructuring for responsive design across screen sizes. This way, I can have assurance that my website will
work on mobile, tablet and desktop. Below are the current features and which stories/criteria they tick:
